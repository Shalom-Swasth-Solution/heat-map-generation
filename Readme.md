# Foot Pressure Distribution Visualizer

An interactive **Streamlit application** for visualizing and analyzing **foot pressure distribution data** collected from sensors.  

The app allows users to upload CSV files with sensor data (L1â€“L40 for left foot, R1â€“R40 for right foot) or work with sample data. It then generates **dynamic heatmaps of foot pressure over time**, provides playback controls, screenshots, and generates detailed pressure and balance reports.
